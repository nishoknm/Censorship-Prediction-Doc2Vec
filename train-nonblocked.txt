The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, commonly known as the June Fourth Incident or '89 Democracy Movement in Chinese, were student-led popular demonstrations in Beijing which took place in the first half of 1989 and received broad support from city residents, exposing deep splits within China's political leadership
The Tiananmen Square protests were forcibly suppressed by hardline leaders who ordered the military to enforce martial law in the country's capital
The crackdown that initiated on June 3â€“4 became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or the June 4 Massacre as troops with assault rifles and tanks killed unarmed civilians trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, which students and other demonstrators had occupied for seven weeks
The Chinese government condemned the Tiananmen Square protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, and has largely prohibited discussion and remembrance of the events
The Tiananmen Square protests were triggered in April 1989 by the death of former Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang, a liberal reformer who was deposed after losing a power struggle with hardliners over the direction of political and economic reforms
